## Data Structures:

* **Singly Linked List** â€” a data structure comprised of nodes with pointers. The pointer of each node directs towards the next node down the list. Each node has only a single link to another node. 

* **Doubly Linked List** - a data structure, like a Singly Linked List, comprised of nodes with pointers. Like the SLL, each node has pointers, however they have two pointers: one pointing to the next node (towards the tail) and one pointing towards the previous node (towards the head). Each node has two links to other nodes. 

* **Stack** - a "stacked" data structure which uses the "last in, first out" method to store nodes. It inherits from the Singly Linked List. 

* **Queue** - a list/"queue" of nodes. All nodes enter from one side, and exit from the other. Nodes point in only one direction. 

## Time Complexities:

* .push()
    *The time complexity for this method is O(1), because regardless of the linked list's length, the time of the push operation will always be the same.*

* .pop()
    *The time complexity for this method is O(1), because regardless of the linked list's length, the time of the pop operation will always be the same.*

## Time Complexities:

#### .push()
The time complexity for this method is O(1), because regardless of the linked list's length, the time of the push operation will always be the same.

#### .pop()
The time complexity for this method is O(1), because regardless of the linked list's length, the time of the pop operation will always be the same.
